The main points that I want to get across in this presentation is </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Know your technology stack inside and out. This is everything from your code editor, to javascript plugins, to grid systems, to your base theme.</li>\n<li>Simplify your theming stack as much as possible.</li>\n<li>Don’t be afraid to try out new technologies - this is how you become proficient.</li>\n<li>Limit what you’re learning to a couple new technologies per project. This way, the new technologies won’t get in the way of your project, and you’ll be able to evaluate, learn, and use them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mherchel/lean-mean-and-maintainable-theming-drupal-theming-best-practices">https://speakerdeck.com/mherchel/lean-mean-and-maintainable-theming-drupal-theming-best-practices</a></p>',frontmatter:{title:"Florida DrupalCamp Presentation Notes",date:"October 20, 2013"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2014-03-08-forida-drupalcamp-presentation-notes/"}}}});
