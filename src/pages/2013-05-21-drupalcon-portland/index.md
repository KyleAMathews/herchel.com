It was an amazing experience to present at Drupalcon Portland. In front of a packed room of ~300 people, I gave this presentation that I had previously given at Drupalcamp Atlanta 2012. The main take-away that I want people to learn is that it takes time and effort to make Drupal's authoring experience awesome.

This presentation covers a lot of real-world techniques and methodologies on how to make Drupal rock for the back end!

Enjoy!
