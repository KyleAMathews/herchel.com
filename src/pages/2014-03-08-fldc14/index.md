Below are my slides from my Drupal theming best practices presentation at the most awesome Florida Drupalcamp ever! The main points that I want to get across in this presentation is 

* Know your technology stack inside and out. This is everything from your code editor, to javascript plugins, to grid systems, to your base theme.
* Simplify your theming stack as much as possible.
* Don't be afraid to try out new technologies - this is how you become proficient.
* Limit what you're learning to a couple new technologies per project. This way, the new technologies won't get in the way of your project, and you'll be able to evaluate, learn, and use them.

Enjoy!
