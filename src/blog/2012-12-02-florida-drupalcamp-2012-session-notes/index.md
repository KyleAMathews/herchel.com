Slidedeck from my 2012 Florida Drupalcamp presentation, "Notes from SEO and Drupal: Best Practices and Tools".

Drupal has an awesome array of tooling and contrib modules that enable it to be on par with the best content management systems in terms of SEO. That being said, like most things Drupal, it doesn't come configured out of the box, and it takes a good amount of knowledge and a bit of work to put everything together.
