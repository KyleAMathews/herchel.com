I was fortunate to be the lead front-end developer on the project. The new Syfy design called for some very complex animations that were directly bound to the scroll event. So, on every scroll, animations would progress a certain amount.</p>\n<p>One of the most difficult challenges was to make these interactions performant on slower computers. To do this, I had to dive deep into how browsers render pixels on screen, and then use this knowledge to optimize the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to make it performant as possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>@mikeherchel nothing standing out to me on desktop, even while emulating. would need to try it on my device on 3G to evaluate the rest.</p>\n<p>— Paul Irish (@paul_irish) March 29, 2015</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I spoke on this topic at <a href="http://2015.fldrupal.camp/">Florida Drupalcamp 2015</a>, and I also gave an abbreviated version of the talk, a week later, at <a href="http://barcamporlando.org/">Orlando Barcamp 2015</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>@mikeherchel teaching wizardry #fldc15 pic.twitter.com/gwrFytzjo3</p>\n<p>— Tobias Williams (@widescreen_bob) April 11, 2015</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mherchel/making-syfy-dot-coms-scroll-interactions-not-suck">https://speakerdeck.com/mherchel/making-syfy-dot-coms-scroll-interactions-not-suck</a></p>',frontmatter:{title:"Making Scroll Animations on Syfy.com Not Suck",date:"April 19, 2015"}}},pathContext:{slug:"blog/2015-04-19-making-syfy-animations-not-suck/"}}}});
